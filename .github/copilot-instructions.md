## Project Overview
This is a React.js project built with Vite that demonstrates a table UI using Ant Design components.

## Key Technologies
- **React 19.1.1**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Ant Design (antd)**: UI component library for professional-looking interfaces
